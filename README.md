# Studio X: Xscape The Cave

**Studio X: Xscape The Cave** is a Virtual Reality escape room built in Unity. It is an adaptation of the in-person escape room **Caving Gone Wrong** that was created by [iZone](https://www.library.rochester.edu/spaces/izone) and exhibited during the Fall 2025 Meliora Weekend at the University of Rochester.

This project was created by Studio X student employees.

## Technologies Used

[Unity Editor 6000.0.58f2](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.58f2) was used for game development, using the XR interaction toolkit. 

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) was used for 3D modeling and texturing. All 3D models in the game were created by Studio X student employees.

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) was used for version control.

## How To Play

Simply download the most recent APK file from the [Releases](https://github.com/RCL-Studio-X/Studio-X-Escape-Room/releases) page and load it onto your Meta Quest headset using a tool like [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) or [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/).

Currently, only Meta Quest devices are supported. We are planning on expanding our releases to other devices once the project is out of beta. If you so desire, you can open the project in the Unity Editor and building the application yourself for your particular device.
